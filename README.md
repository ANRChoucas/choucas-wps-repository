# choucas-wps-repository

## Description
Source code and tools needed to build the service catalogue. This is the initial version of the catalogue supported by the 52North WPS platform. This version is obsolete. We have started to move the catalogue to the 52North javaps platform. Once all the adapters are moved, this project will be deleted.  

## Installation
The repository is packaged as an Eclipse/Maven project.
